Inspiration
Nil and I lived for 6 months in Puerto Rico right before the Hurricane Maria hit the island on September 16th.

We got really attached to the island, its culture and its inhabitants.

We discovered the island in a moment when its tourism was booming and thought of trying to understand the impact of hurricane Maria on this segment of the island's economic activity.

How we built it
We used our company's data to analyse Airbnb traveler's patterns into the island and represented that onto a map thanks to Esri's technology. We then embedded the results into an HTML template.
